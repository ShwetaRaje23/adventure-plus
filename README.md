# adventure-plus
A website to link potential adventure seekers with everything they want

#What it does
1. It is a social netwrok that connects people from everywhere.
2. It is focused on the adventure seekers as a customer base

#Simplicity of design
1. The design has two lists for every individual person called:
  a. Want to do:
    i. It is like a bucket list of all the things you have done. 
    Eg: Skydiving, bunjee jumping, etc.
    
  b. Done:
    i. This is a list of things you have already done.

2. The people who have things in their done list need to add certain details on the things that they did so that their friends/followers can use those detiails.
